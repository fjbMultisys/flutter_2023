- Set up your development environment and run a simple "Hello World" app to ensure everything is working.
- Read about the Flutter Widgets and learn how to use them to build the user interface.

Day 2:
- Learn the basics of Dart programming language, the language used in Flutter.
- Work on the interactive "Dartpad" on flutter.dev to practice Dart concepts.
- Resources:
	- Dart official website (https://dart.dev/guides)
	- Dartpad (https://dartpad.dev)
- Study the basics of Dart programming language, which is used in Flutter development. (Link: https://dart.dev/guides)
- Learn about stateless and stateful widgets and when to use each.
- Build a simple app using stateless and stateful widgets.

Day 3:
- Learn about Flutter Layouts and how to use them to create complex UI designs.
- Learn about the Flutter Animation and how to add animation to your app. (Link: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/animations)
- Learn about Flutter widgets and architecture.
- Start building simple UI elements using Flutter widgets.
- Resources:
	- Flutter Widgets Catalog (https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets)
	- Widget of the Week (https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets/widget-of-the-week)

Day 2-3:
- Read the Flutter widget catalog to understand the different types of widgets available: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets
- Work through the Flutter tutorials on the official website: https://flutter.dev/docs/tutorials
- Work on a small project of your own to practice what you have learned

Day 4:

- Learn how to add additional functionality to your app such as camera access, maps, etc. (Link: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/using-packages)

Day 4-5:
- Watch more advanced tutorials on YouTube to learn about more complex topics such as state management, routing, and APIs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS36gBEp8OI
- Join the Flutter community on Discord to ask questions and get help from other Flutter developers: https://discord.gg/flutter
- Learn about state management in Flutter, including the Provider package.
- Practice building simple apps with state management.
- Resources:
	- Flutter state management guide (https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt)
	- Provider package documentation (https://pub.dev/packages/provider)

Day 6-7:

- Work on a bigger project to put your skills to the test or work on a project of your own to apply what you've learned.
- Read about the best practices for building Flutter apps: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/best-practices
- Solve problems and debug your code using the Flutter tools and resources. (Link: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools)

Note: These steps are just a rough guideline, feel free to adjust it to your pace and learning style. Also, make sure to practice as much as you can, as this will help you solidify your knowledge.
